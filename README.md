As a freelance web developer, you understand the importance of branding your projects. With LogoGen, you now have the power to effortlessly create simple yet captivating logos, eliminating the need for costly graphic designers. 

**LogoGen** is a command-line application designed to provide you with a hassle-free logo creation experience. Here's how it works:

1. **Text Input**: Upon launching LogoGen, you'll be prompted to enter up to three characters to be featured in your logo.

2. **Text Color Selection**: Next, choose the color of your text by entering a color keyword or a hexadecimal number.

3. **Shape Selection**: LogoGen offers a variety of shapes to complement your text. Choose from options like circle, triangle, or square.

4. **Shape Color Selection**: Just like with the text, specify the color of your chosen shape using either a color keyword or a hexadecimal number.

Once you've provided input for all prompts, LogoGen will swiftly generate an SVG file named `logo.svg` and display the message "Generated logo.svg" in the command line. 

Finally, open the `logo.svg` file in your browser to behold your custom-designed logo. With dimensions of 300x200 pixels, your logo will perfectly fit the criteria you've entered, ready to enhance the visual identity of your projects.
